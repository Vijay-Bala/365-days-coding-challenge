238. Product of Array Except Self

DESCRIPTION:

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

DESCRIPTION:

Given an integer array arr and an integer difference, return the length of the longest subsequence in arr which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals difference.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from arr by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
